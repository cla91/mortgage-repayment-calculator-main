- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several key concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript: I used an ES6 class, MortgageCalculator, to encapsulate the data and logic. This improved code organization and reusability.
- Modular JavaScript: By separating the calculator logic into its own class and using a Formatter utility, I created a more maintainable and scalable codebase. This is a crucial skill for building larger applications.
- Mortgage Calculation Logic: I learned the distinct mathematical formulas required for calculating repayment and interest-only mortgages. This highlighted the importance of tailoring logic to specific use cases.
- DOM Manipulation: I practiced selecting and updating DOM elements dynamically based on user input, ensuring the user interface reflects the calculated results in real-time.

### Useful resources

- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) - This helped me for mortagage formulas, which I had no idea about.
